            <p>I try not to give away too much on my book reviews (especially since they go onto Goodreads and qualifying everything with <em>spoilers</em> is a chore). But I especially loved this very personal journey into the mind of one of Britain&rsquo;s greatest neurosurgeons - his triumphs, his failures, and the emotional turmoil behind the scenes.</p>
<p>This was a very refreshing genre for me - I&rsquo;ve had my fair share of medical TV dramas but not dived into books like these. Another major draw is the context in which this book is situated - the field of neurosurgery, which is still very much a fascinating black box.</p>
<p>Henry Marsh writes wonderfully: he has a strong and distinctive voice that tells you as it is - not only about his experiences, but also who he is as a person, unabashedly. (Whether you think you might like the man as a friend or colleague is a separate matter altogether.)</p>
<p>Through this very real and personal account, Marsh achieves the objective he established at the beginning of the book - reminding us as readers that doctors are not as superhuman as we make them to be, and they too go through very human challenges.</p>
<p>P.S. A very timely read as our medical workers on the frontlines are working tirelessly and doing their best to keep us all safe in COVID-19 times. Show your appreciation where you can!</p>
