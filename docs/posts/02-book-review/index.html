            <p>If you&rsquo;re Singaporean - read this book. If you live in a world where there are people who could own up to twelve cars (cue Selling Sunset), and also people who might not have a roof over their heads - read this book. You will be surprised, challenged, compelled to think, and will keep thinking.</p>
<p>This is Part 1 of my quest to read more Singaporean literature (fiction and non-fiction alike). After hearing so much about Teo You Yenn&rsquo;s much raved about book &ldquo;This Is What Inequality Looks Like&rdquo; - I had to add it to the list. The verdict - a very solid five stars.</p>
<p>But be prepared: <strong>reading TIWILL is uncomfortable.</strong> It offers not only a level of scrutiny over the lives of a group of people often considered &ldquo;invisible&rdquo;, but also a deep examination into the values and preconceptions of the reader. The book achieves the same effect that I believe Parasite did for many viewers - introducing an undercurrent of thinking, generating more thoughts with yet another observation of something (an object, a person, an activity). Previously innocuous, but now laden with meaning.</p>
<p>TIWILL is very much a collection of vignettes - providing a peek into multiple dimensions of the lives of the low-income. Teo has (quite consciously, I believe) avoided dramatising these differences - instead, she invites you to step into the smallness, but also the warmth, of the homes of a socio-economic group that is often swept under the carpet. As the reader is immersed in the physical, mental, and emotional spaces in which the low-income operate in daily, he/she is inadvertently forced to challenge his/her understanding (and/or stereotypes) around what poverty looks like, what drives poverty, and why poverty is so difficult to change / eradicate.</p>
<p>TIWILL doesn&rsquo;t offer answers to how the situation for lower-income individuals can be improved - it is, after all, highly complex (something which readers will better appreciate by the end of the book) and this book is not written with the purpose of directing / defining policy. But TIWILL provides exactly the first step we need: to start thinking about who we are, who we <em>want</em> to be, what we want <em>our society</em> to be.</p>
<p>As Teo writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We who have the power to make choices disproportionately shape outcomes and limit options for those people who don&rsquo;t have the power to make choices.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
